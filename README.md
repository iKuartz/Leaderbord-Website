"Leaderbord-Website" is a simple website that displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

### First requirements:


   
    IMPORTANT NOTE This is the first time you will use Gitflow. Keep that in mind!
    Create an npm project with webpack. (If you need a refresher, check the previous project or webpack exercise).
    Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps. 
    Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).
    Use ES6 modules, with import and export.
